== PROJECT: Book Squirrel

---

== Overview

BookSquirrel(v1.3) is for those who want to keep a record of books theyâ€™ve read. More importantly, BookSquirrel is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookSquirrel can get your note management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
